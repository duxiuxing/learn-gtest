| sample1 | shows the basic steps of using googletest to test C++ functions. |  |  | √ |
| sample2 | shows a more complex unit test for a class with multiple member functions. |  |  | √ |
| sample3 | uses a test fixture. |  |  | √ |
| sample4 | teaches you how to use googletest and `googletest.h` together to get the best of both libraries. |  |  | √ |
| sample5 | puts shared testing logic in a base test fixture, and reuses it in derived fixtures. |  |  | √ |
| sample6 | demonstrates type-parameterized tests. |  |  | √ |
| sample7 | teaches the basics of value-parameterized tests. |  |  | √ |
| sample8 | shows using `Combine()` in value-parameterized tests. |  |  | √ |
| sample9 | shows use of the listener API to modify Google Test's console output and the use of its reflection API to inspect test results. |  |  | √ |
| sample10 | shows use of the listener API to implement a primitive memory leak checker. |  |  | √ |
